Artemis Financial Security Report
Client Overview and Software Requirements
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that needed a security assessment to identify vulnerabilities in its software systems. The company’s primary concern was ensuring that its applications followed secure coding practices and were protected from common threats like injection attacks, authentication flaws, and insecure data handling. My task was to conduct a vulnerability assessment and recommend mitigation strategies to enhance software security.

Identifying Software Security Vulnerabilities
I effectively identified vulnerabilities by analyzing the application’s code, testing for common security flaws, and using automated security tools. Secure coding is essential because it prevents data breaches, protects sensitive financial information, and ensures regulatory compliance. Implementing strong security practices adds value to a company by building customer trust, reducing financial risks, and improving overall system reliability.

Challenges and Security Enhancements
One of the challenges I faced was prioritizing vulnerabilities—determining which issues posed the most significant risk and required immediate remediation. To increase security layers, I implemented techniques such as input validation, encryption for sensitive data, and enforcing strong authentication measures. In future assessments, I would leverage tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and automated static code analyzers to detect and mitigate security flaws more efficiently.

Ensuring Functionality and Security
After refactoring the code to fix security vulnerabilities, I ensured its functionality through unit testing, integration testing, and security audits. I also conducted regression testing to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. This step was crucial in maintaining both security and software performance.

Useful Tools and Future Applications
For this project, I used secure coding best practices, automated security scanning tools, and manual code review techniques. These resources will be valuable in future software development and security roles. If an employer were to review my work, I would showcase this security report as an example of my ability to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities, perform structured assessments, and enhance software security for real-world applications.
